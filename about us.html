                     At Apptopia, we want to solve the biggest problem in mobile: everyone is <br>
                     guessing. <br><br><br>

 

                    Publishers need to know what apps to build, how to monetize them, and where <br>
                    to price them. Advertisers and brands need to identify their target users, and <br>
                    determine where to allocate resources in order to reach them most effectively. <br>
                    Investors need to know which apps and genres are growing the quickest, and <br>
                    where users are really spending their time (and money). <br><br><br>

 

                    In business, we need data to make informed decisions. Apptopia provides the <br> 
                    most actionable mobile app insights in the industry. We aim to make this data <br>
                    available to as many people as possible. <br>
