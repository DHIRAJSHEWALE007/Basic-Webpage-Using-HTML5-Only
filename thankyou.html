        You know that wonderful, warm-fuzzy feeling that comes over you when someone goes out of his or her way to spoil you, <br>
        feed you, treat you, welcome you, bless you, support you or help you out? Of course you do. <br>
        The feeling is gratitude, and it feels even better when you express it! <br><br><br>

        A handwritten card or note of thanks is one of the most heartfelt and meaningful ways to express gratitude. <br> 
        Maybe you can’t repay your recipient for the nice thing he or she has done, <br>
        but you can reflect the thoughtfulness with the time and care you put into writing and sending a warm, gracious thank-you card or note. <br><br><br>
        
        If you need a little help getting beyond, “Thanks so much…,” you’re in the right place. <br> 
        Our “What to Write in a Thank-You Card” guide is full of thank-you-writing inspiration and message ideas from Hallmark writers. <br>
        Whether you read the whole guide or skip to your specific thank-you situation, we hope it adds to the feel-good factor of putting your thanks in writing. <br><br><br>
